## "makeCacheMatrix" takes a matrix as parameter and 
## creates an object of a matrix whose inverse Matrix can be cached.
## The "cacheSolve" function takes such an object and returns the inverse matrix,
## either by retrieving a cached value or calculating it.

## Create a new cachable matrix from a standard matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## Calculate the inverse of the supplied matrix,
## returning a cached value if possible
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
